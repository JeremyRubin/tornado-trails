#Tornado Standard Template
## Introduction & Motivation
In effort to ease the developement on tornado, I am developing a standard model tornado app.  

##Requirements:
- tornado (works with 3.0.2)  
- asyncmongo (1.2.2)
- pymongo  
- mongoDB  
- python
  
##Setup
To set this up, simply fill out the config.py file, then run $ python run.py

For deployment, you **will** want to run it behind nginx. An example config is included.
